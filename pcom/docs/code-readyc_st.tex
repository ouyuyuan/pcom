\item Stored |pbt_st(:,:,1)| in |pbt(:,:,tau)|
\item Calc. $P$ in (\ref{eq:43})
\item (|call upwelling|){\color{red}I don't understand this part yet}
I guess it diagnose the vertical velocity $w$, but in a $p$-coordinate.
\item calculate horizontal advection velocities $u$ and $v$ in (\ref{eq:44}).
