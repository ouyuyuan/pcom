\item In setcon.f90, Line 65-66, it cut vmix.nc value to fit |kh_max|, but didn't 
cut vmix to fit |kh_min|, i.e., |kh_c|

Also, the code want to set missing value to 0.1, but it seems it doesn't work.
The missing value are still unchanged. See the test on 101, case
|pcom_1.0\exp02_check|

\item In the old code of Huang and Jin, $A_m$ and $A_h$ is different by 10 times, but
now they are the same. see Line 208,209 of |setcon.f90|. Can change them back
in the namelist of |am_c| and |ah_c|, to see the effects.

\item In main.f90, it defined allocatable arrays before MPI initialization, may
  be MPI init. should put in the very first?

\item Set |pbt_st| to 1 where it is zero at the beginning of |ready_st.f90|
