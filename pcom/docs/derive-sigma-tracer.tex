\subsection{Tracer Equations}
\label{der:tracer-sig}

We take potential temperature $T$ as an example.

By rule of difference
\beeq \label{eq:15}
\dptdt = \pbt\fd{T}{t} + T\fd{\pbt}{t}
\eneq
From the tracer equation in $z$-coordinate of (\ref{eq:12}) the the relation ship
of substantial time difference operator in $z$ and $\sigma$ coordinate of
(\ref{eq:3}), we have
\beeq \label{eq:14}
\dtdts = \mqt
\eneq
And from the mass conservation equation (\ref{eq:8}) we have
\beeq
\fp{\pbt}{t} + \vv\cdot\gn\pbt + \pbt\divv = 0
\eneq
\beeq \label{eq:13}
\fd{\pbt}{t} = - \pbt\divv
\eneq
Substitute (\ref{eq:13}) and (\ref{eq:14}) into (\ref{eq:15}), we have
\beeq
\dptdt = \pbt\mqt - T\pbt\divv
\eneq
And substantial change equal local change plus advective term
\beeq
\dptdt = \pptpt + \vv\cdot\gn(\pbt T)
\eneq
Combine the above two equations, we get
\beeq
\pptpt+\divptv = \pbt\mqt
\eneq
