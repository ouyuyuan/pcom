Set $A_m$, $A_h$, $\gkm$ and $\gkh$ in equation \ref{eq:37} and
equation \ref{eq:38}.

$A_m$ is determined by |fam| in |namelist|.
\bi
\item If |fam| = 1, read from file
\item Otherwise, set to |am_c| ($10^7$) in the |namelist|
\ei

$A_h$ is determined by |fah| in |namelist|.
\bi
\item If |fah| = 1, read from file
\item Otherwise, set to |ah_c| ($10^7$) in the |namelist|
\ei

$\gkh$ is determined by \ft{fkh} in \ft{namelist}.
\bi
\item If \ft{fkh} = 1, read $\gkh$ from file
\item If \ft{fkh} = 2, set $\gkh$ as a function of layers.
\item Otherwise, set $\gkh$ to \ft{kh\_c} (0.1) in the \ft{namelist}
\ei

$\gkm$ is determined by \ft{fkm} in \ft{namelist}.
\bi
\item If \ft{fkm} = 1, read $\gkm$ from file
\item Otherwise, set $\gkm$ as a function of layers
\ei

Set restoring coefficient of $\ggt$ and $\ggs$,
