\subsection{The Boundary Conditions}

At all side walls and bottom, the velocity is zero and there is no
heat and salt flux cross bottom and lateral boundary. At the free
surface ($\gs=0$), the kinematic boundary conditions are
\begin{align} \label{eq:27}
  \pbt\dgs &= -\rho_{0}gF_{E-P},\\
  \rsgp A_{v}\pups &= -\tau_{\gl},\\
  \rsgp A_{v}\pvps &= -\tau_{\gf},
\end{align}
 where $F_{E-P}$ is the rate of evaporation minus precipitation;
$\rho_{0}$ is the density of fresh water; $\tau_{\lambda}$ and $\tau_{\gf}$
represent the zonal and meridional component wind stress, respectively.
Note that the river runoff may be taken into account by combined with
evaporation minus precipitation.

The turbulent mixing for temperature at sea surface is 
\begin{equation}
  \rsgp \gk_{v} \fp{T}{\gs} = -\frac{F_{h}}{C_{p}},
\end{equation}
where $F_{h}$ is the air-sea heat flux, $C_{p}$ is the heat capacity
of sea water.

The restoring boundary condition may be written as
\begin{equation}
\rsgp \gk_{v} \fp{S}{\gs} = -\f{\pbt\gd\gs_{1}}{g\tau_{s}}(S^{*}-S_{1}),
\end{equation}
 where $\tau_{s}$ is the restoring time scale, $\delta\gs_{1}$
is the upper layer resolution in the pressure-$\gs$ coordinates,
$S^{*}$ is the observed sea surface salinity, and $S_{1}$ is the
salinity in the upper layer.

The natural boundary condition \citep{Huang1993} is
\begin{equation}
\rsgp\fp{S}{\gs}=-S_{1}\rho_{0}F_{E-P}.
\end{equation}
 Note the turbulent salt flux at the sea surface exactly balances
the vertical advection flux induced by the imbalance of evaporation
minus precipitation, so that the total salt flux cross the air-sea
interface is zero.
